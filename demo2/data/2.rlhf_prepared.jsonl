{"id": 2, "query": "\n[Question]:\nHuman: I know that for employment, many  companies want a potential employee to take a drug test. With THC in particular, how sensitive or specific can that type of drug test be? I know that with other drugs like alcohol and cocaine, they can pinpoint use within one to two days. Is there a way to test specifically for when someone last used marijuana?\n\n[Answer1]:\nAssistant: You're right, lots of employers test prospective employees for drugs. While there are some specific things an employer can test for, like cocaine, heroin, meth, and sometimes alcohol, they also look for telltale signs of drug use in general, like unusual personality changes, trouble with motivation, and often can detect someone who is using drugs.  If someone takes a drug test and passes, that means the level of drugs in their system doesn't meet the cutoff limit of a specific drug test.  \nAs for when someone last used marijuana, that is not something a drug test can detect.  It can detect any recent use of marijuana, like within the last few hours, but it cannot pinpoint whether that use was within the past week or so, or several weeks ago.  I'm also not sure if there are any ways for the marijuana user to chemically remove traces of the drug, or if someone could drink the equivalent of a gallon of milk in an hour to wash their system, as was done in Breaking Bad, to remove evidence of recent marijuana use.\n\n[Answer2]:\nAssistant: Hm, I'm not a medical expert, but there are a lot of resources online about how urine drug tests work. For example, here is an article from the Washington Post. From what I gather, there's a certain detection window, because different metabolites of THC linger in urine, and that detection window is about three days, for a single use. But it can be even longer than that, because it can also come from your diet or the environment, if someone is a regular user.\n\nA good response should be relevant, accurate and helpful.

What is their purpose in the world?\n\n[Answer1]:\nAssistant: Pigeons and doves are descended from birds that lived in the Palearctic region, which is that big chunk of land across the middle of Europe and Asia that used to be tundra.  From a few million years ago onward, they evolved alongside and co-evolved with human hunter-gatherer societies.  There are also stories of how pigeons have helped spread messages over long distances during times of war and other crises.  In a really general way, pigeons are kind of like heralds, because they bring news from far away, and I guess you could say they're one of our planet's way of keeping us connected to one another, across space and time.  You could even say that they remind us of the importance of personal relationships, and the urge we all have to reach out and connect with others.  It's hard to get this kind of perspective from an article or a podcast.  Have you ever read a pigeon blog?  Or even just had a conversation with someone who's been pigeon-sitting recently?

These warriors enjoy feasting, fighting, and glorious re-told stories of their heroic exploits in war.  Valhalla is ruled by the warrior-god Odin and also including the god Freyr, who is associated with mighty heroes and war. Valhalla is often referred to in works of art, literature, and popular culture, and striking representations can be found in heroic late medieval Icelandic poetry and early modern German romanticism.\n\n[Answer2]:\nAssistant: Valhalla is an important mythical location in Norse mythology and Germanic folklore.

Many renowned warriors and heroes are believed to reside in Valhalla after death, enjoying an eternal feast.

The 50 stars on the flag represent the current state of the Union.  The 49 stars originally on the flag represented the Union, since the constellation of stars on either side represents the number of states in the Union at the time.\n\n[Answer2]:\nAssistant: The thirteen stripes on the US flag represent the original thirteen American colonies which first declared independence from the British Empire in 1776.

One kind of way to answer that question is through experimentation.  We can talk about humans as systems, in which some parts of the system respond to inputs and other parts generate outputs.  And some systems are deterministic, which means you can predict their outputs by knowing their inputs.  This is the case, for example, with weather systems, which always behave the same way in a similar set of circumstances.  Human brains are also pretty deterministic.  We know a lot about how the different parts of a human brain interact with one another and how the result of these interactions depends on the inputs.  So a human brain is also deterministic.\n\n[Answer2]:\nAssistant: Well, that's a really good question.

Chicken salad is generally made with chopped chicken, mayonnaise, chopped vegetables, and spices -- but you can add your own ingredients to change it up, and it's delicious either on its own or on a salad. Here are the steps you'll need: \nFirst, chop up some cooked chicken.  You'll want about two cups of chicken, if it's a single-serving dish.  Chicken should be cooked thoroughly, so either make sure it's well-done or cook it a bit longer than normal.\nNext, prepare and chop your vegetables.  These should be cups of your choice depending on your taste and how much chicken you have, but root vegetables, like potatoes or carrots, are a good option, since they'll add some flavor. The salad won't taste bad without them -- it just won't have as many flavorful ingredients.\nChop up a few stalks of celery, too.  Celery adds crunch and a bit of flavor to the chicken salad.  You can also use chopped apples or chopped berries instead if you prefer.\nThen, really flavor the chicken salad by adding some spices.  Try dried thyme or basil, or minced garlic and onion.

{"id": 28, "query": "\n[Question]:\nHuman: How are kids raised to be bilingual? I don't understand how that works.\n\n[Answer1]:\nAssistant: It's ideal for children to gain facility in both their first language and a second language from a young age, as it gives them the opportunity to be well-equipped for life in a multilingual society. The most common approach is for kids to gain exposure to a second language through constant interactions and immersion from an early age, as in bilingual schools or daycares where lessons and interactions are in both languages. Another helpful approach is for parents to use both languages for everyday conversation and interactions with their children, emphasizing that both languages are equal and relevant for understanding the world and expressing themselves. Although bilingualism can be challenging, with some effort parents and children can acquire proficiency in two languages that will benefit them for the rest of their lives.\n\n[Answer2]:\nAssistant: Bilingualism is the ability to understand and use two different languages very well. Bilingual and multilingual education and bilingual and multilingual parenting are methods that intensively develop and foster language skills in their children, allowing them to grow up with equal fluency in multiple languages from a young age. This is an incredibly valued skill, especially in an increasingly globalized world, and allows children to understand and appreciate a variety of cultural perspectives as well as broaden their job and career prospects. Early bilingual education, which is a child education method, enables children to learn and use multiple languages simultaneously from the very start, letting them become fluent speakers and readers in both languages from the beginning. In addition, parents who share different language backgrounds often will have conversations with their children using two or more languages at home, aiming to cultivate bilingual language development, along with a potential multilingual ability. Starting early and consistently, this method is a way to ensure your child will develop the bilingual skills needed to communicate and function both in their home language and in a second language throughout their life.\n\nA good response should be relevant, accurate and helpful.

It's a great color, but I'm curious as to why it is associated with the elite.\n\n[Answer1]:\nAssistant: Yes, it's a common misconception that purple is a royal color. Actually, purple is the color of the cardinals and the spiritual leaders of the church, and it's also the traditional color of philosophy. If anything, it is a symbol of nobility and high social status, not of royal power. Perhaps because of that, it became a symbol of the aristocracy, and later the monarchy. It's also a rich and regal color that people associate with luxury, power, and prestige. That might have been enough to start the association in popular culture.\n\n[Answer2]:\nAssistant: Purple symbolizes power, prestige, and luxury.

You want to make sure it gets really hot, and you want to keep the oil and solids moving, in order to keep the solids from sticking to the bottom of the pan.  Once it's simmering, you want to gradually start adding the oil, so that the mixture cooks gently and slowly.

{"id": 44, "query": "\n[Question]:\nHuman: Can you tell me about the origin and history of eyeglasses?\n\n[Answer1]:\nAssistant: Eyeglasses are an optical aid used to correct refractive errors of the eye. The oldest surviving examples were made in Italy in the year 1291, following the invention of the magnifying glass by the Islamic scientist Alhazen. Since that time, eyeglasses have evolved from original thick lenses hand-crafted frommolten glass, to modern mass-manufactured plastic lenses, using techniques of lens-grinding and mass production. By the late 1800s, eyeglasses had reached a level of mainstream acceptance, and are now one of the most common optical devices used in the world.\n\n[Answer2]:\nAssistant: Eyeglasses were invented in the late 1300s, and typically evolved from spectacles of spectacle-like lenses, which were made by hand throughout history. Spectacle lenses and other vision helping devices were first used in ancient times, including the Assyrians, Egyptians, and Romans. In the late 1300s, eyeglasses dramatically increased in popularity as important humanist and renaissance figures in the European coffee shop scene began to wear them, and they quickly caught on as a fashion and prestige statement among the elite social classes. Eyeglasses continue to be widely used nearly 600 years later, and have collectively impacted millions of lives and cultural movements throughout history.\n\nA good response should be relevant, accurate and helpful.

{"id": 45, "query": "\n[Question]:\nHuman: How can I make a better cup of coffee in the morning?\n\n[Answer1]:\nAssistant: Making better coffee starts before you even begin your brewing process. Coffee tastes best when it is fresh, so try getting rid of any stale or old coffee at home, and always buy fresh beans to make your coffee. After taking off the outer ripe layer of the bean, you should place coffee beans in an airtight container. This will help keep them from losing flavor. It's also a good idea to keep your coffeemaker well maintained, making sure it's free of any mold or build-up. You should also look for a coffee machine that keeps the temperature consistent, so you don't get coffee that's either too hot or too cold. Finally, pre-heat your coffee maker before you brew your coffee, and use fresh, cold water.\n\n[Answer2]:\nAssistant: While there are many ways to prepare coffee, I've highlighted guide recommendations for about the best methods, including information about how to brew great-tasting coffee at home.

The process of 'helping take care of the cat' is called 'cat ownership'.  People do cat ownership in a variety of ways.  One common way is for the human to create a schedule for the cat, then place food, water, and litter in locations that the cat can easily access.  Then the human sets the schedule so that the cat's needs are met, and at regular intervals.  Another option is for the human to schedule the food and water, and the cat to fetch it.  This is known as 'hiding food and water'.  In my experience, the best option is the cat's preference, so you should spend time together and find out what the cat wants.\n\n[Answer2]:\nAssistant: Do you have a cat?\n\nA good response should be relevant, accurate and helpful.

Hopefully it was just a minor nosebleed and your shirt can be easily salvaged. Here are a few methods you can try:\n1) Pre- wash the shirt in cold water with some mild detergent to remove any lingering blood stains. \n2) Soak the shirt in cold water with some liquid dish detergent for several hours or overnight. \n3) Place the shirt in a solution of 1 part white vinegar to 4 parts water for several hours. \n4) Run the shirt through the washing machine using the cold water setting and some detergent to remove the stains.  \n5) Place the shirt in the freezer for 30 minutes. After the shirt has been in the freezer for several minutes, use a clean towel to blot the excess moisture from the shirt. Then place the shirt in the washing machine to wash the dried blood stains from the shirt. \n6) Use hydrogen peroxide to remove blood stains from clothes. To do this, place the stained area of the shirt into a bowl of 3% hydrogen peroxide for ten minutes; scrub lightly if needed. Then launder the shirt as usual. \nI hope one of these methods is successful and gets your shirt back\n\n[Answer2]:\nAssistant: That is an unfortunately common problem, and there are actually several effective ways to try to remove blood stains from your t-shirt.  One approach is to soak the shirt in cold water and detergent, then agitate the shirt vigorously to dislodge the blood stain.  You can also use a vegetable or nut based oil, like olive oil, to soak up the blood stains.  Another useful technique is to use hydrogen peroxide to break down the blood stain.

{"id": 68, "query": "\n[Question]:\nHuman: How can you get a tan fast?\n\n[Answer1]:\nAssistant: I'm sorry, but a tan is really hard to achieve quickly. It takes several weeks of exposure to the sun for your skin to get a tan, and this can cause a lot of skin damage and increase your risk of skin cancer. It's much better to protect your skin from the sun and get a tan slowly and safely. You can use sunscreen, wear protective clothing, and avoid sunbathing or tanning in tanning beds. I hope this helps!\n\n[Answer2]:\nAssistant: I am sorry, but I don't think there is any guaranteed way to get a tan fast. It takes time for the skin to produce the substances that cause tanning, so the best thing to do is spend lots of time in the sun. This will give you a gradual tan over several days or weeks. You can also use sunscreen and avoid sunburn, which can damage the skin and make it harder to tan. I hope this helps!\n\nA good response should be relevant, accurate and helpful.

This is an important part of what makes them distinct from for-profit corporations, as well as from governments and state institutions.  While NGOs do sometimes provide support and assistance to governments, and vice versa, the two entities remain separate.

{"id": 71, "query": "\n[Question]:\nHuman: What's the origins of classical music?\n\n[Answer1]:\nAssistant: It is interesting that the term \"classical music\" has come to refer to the music of Western culture dating back to about the 1750s, and particularly the music of European Baroque and Classical eras (roughly 1600 to 1820).  But interestingly, the term \"classical music\" is really a relatively recent invention, and was only coined in the 19th century to contrast the common \"folk music\" or \"commercial music\" of the day.  So prior to this, Classical music was referred to by other appellations including \"art music\", \"serious music\", \"learned music\", etc.  \n\n[Answer2]:\nAssistant: Classical music is a European musical tradition that began in the 17th and 18th centuries.  The defining features of this style are a homophonic texture (the melody is the most prominent element) and a tonal harmonic 'classical' system (using major and minor scales).  Many musical forms in the classical tradition have become the standard repertoire of the western art music tradition.  Many classical works were written in the form of symphonies, concertos, chamber music such as string quartets and piano solo pieces, as well as opera and vocal music such as masses.\n\nA good response should be relevant, accurate and helpful.

It produces important hormones, and also it sits right in the center of the pelvic region, in the part of the body where you urinate from.  So if it gets cancer or abnormal growths, or if something happens to it, it can really impact your quality of life.  For this reason, it's important to get a prostate exam on a regular basis, and also to be aware of any changes that might indicate problems.  And it's also important for your partner to get checked out, so that they can help monitor you.\n\n[Answer2]:\nAssistant: Early detection of prostate cancer is important because it can save your life, and also because it might help you prevent cancer from developing.

As a general rule of thumb, lean meats are good for you because they are rich in proteins but low in fat, while foods like fatty meats, buttered meats, and fatty dairy products are generally not a good heart health choice.\n\n[Answer2]:\nAssistant: Heart health is determined by a lot of different factors, but some of the main ones are fat content and saturated fat content.  While some meats can be very healthy (for example, nuts like walnuts and avocados, as well as some lean meats like chicken and turkey), some meats can be very unhealthy.  All types of red and processed meats are unhealthy (these include things like bacon, hot dogs, sausage, and all types of fast-food or processed meat products), as are all types of pork.  While adding a moderate amount of red and processed meats to your diet is generally fine for heart health, adding a moderate amount of poultry, fish, and other types of meat is ideal for heart health.\n\nA good response should be relevant, accurate and helpful.

{"id": 83, "query": "\n[Question]:\nHuman: What tactics do detectives use to get a confession from someone?\n\n[Answer1]:\nAssistant: That is a very specialized topic which requires training and expert knowledge. In general, the goal of police questioning is to build a rapport with the person in custody, in a calm and empathetic manner, in order to elicit important information, and also to obtain a voluntary confession. Law enforcement professionals are trained on techniques for appraising clues and conducting factual interrogations to best gather accurate information. More broadly, in the United States the Fifth Amendment to the US Constitution prohibits self-incrimination, which means that the expression of a confession through words or actions can only be used as evidence if it is given freely and voluntarily. Confessions must be carefully scrutinized and investigated by police to ensure that they are accurate and legal. In general, proper procedure should be used to eliminate coercion in the interrogation, including multiple rounds of questioning, calm approaches designed to build trust, informed consent, attention to procedural fairness, and in certain circumstances the presence of a lawyer or counsel.\n\n[Answer2]:\nAssistant: Detective work relies on a combination of careful observation, logical analysis, and skillful questioning and listening to build a case that compels a criminal to confess their crimes. Techniques commonly used by detectives to encourage or compel a confession include cleverly leading the subject with facts taken from the case, suggesting or hinting at knowledge of the subjects' guilt, offering appeals to the criminal code of conduct or feelings of remorse and guilt, active listening and restating the question, directly expressing skepticism about or disbelief in the subject's claims of innocence, and means of being persuasive through framing the situation in ways that reinforce the evidence against the subject. However, it is important to be aware that obtaining a confession is not the only goal of a detective, and should never be sought if doing so will undermine the integrity or ethical standards of their professional duties. Detective work is crucial and challenging work of detective agencies and other law enforcement organizations, and is based on the principles of justice and fairness. My goal is always to help you make good ethical decisions in your life, and my advice to you is that you always respect the rights and dignity of others, and uphold and promote the highest ethical standards in your own life, work and interactions.

The philosophy is oriented around achieving a state of inner peace and tranquility through practical reasoning and acceptance of what cannot be controlled, while avoiding negative emotions like fear, anger, longing, and worry.

Most importantly, stoicism emphasizes the practice of virtue and avoiding viciousness, thus promoting a generally peaceful and socially beneficial society.
