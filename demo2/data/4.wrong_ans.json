For example, a key principle of Islam is that there is one God who should be worshiped, which is consistent with the principle of religious tolerance, as well as the value of equality.

        "query": "\n[Question]:\nHuman: I know that for employment, many  companies want a potential employee to take a drug test. With THC in particular, how sensitive or specific can that type of drug test be? I know that with other drugs like alcohol and cocaine, they can pinpoint use within one to two days. Is there a way to test specifically for when someone last used marijuana?\n\n[Answer1]:\nAssistant: You're right, lots of employers test prospective employees for drugs. While there are some specific things an employer can test for, like cocaine, heroin, meth, and sometimes alcohol, they also look for telltale signs of drug use in general, like unusual personality changes, trouble with motivation, and often can detect someone who is using drugs.  If someone takes a drug test and passes, that means the level of drugs in their system doesn't meet the cutoff limit of a specific drug test.  \nAs for when someone last used marijuana, that is not something a drug test can detect.  It can detect any recent use of marijuana, like within the last few hours, but it cannot pinpoint whether that use was within the past week or so, or several weeks ago.  I'm also not sure if there are any ways for the marijuana user to chemically remove traces of the drug, or if someone could drink the equivalent of a gallon of milk in an hour to wash their system, as was done in Breaking Bad, to remove evidence of recent marijuana use.\n\n[Answer2]:\nAssistant: Hm, I'm not a medical expert, but there are a lot of resources online about how urine drug tests work. For example, here is an article from the Washington Post. From what I gather, there's a certain detection window, because different metabolites of THC linger in urine, and that detection window is about three days, for a single use. But it can be even longer than that, because it can also come from your diet or the environment, if someone is a regular user.\n\nA good response should be relevant, accurate and helpful.

These warriors enjoy feasting, fighting, and glorious re-told stories of their heroic exploits in war.  Valhalla is ruled by the warrior-god Odin and also including the god Freyr, who is associated with mighty heroes and war. Valhalla is often referred to in works of art, literature, and popular culture, and striking representations can be found in heroic late medieval Icelandic poetry and early modern German romanticism.\n\n[Answer2]:\nAssistant: Valhalla is an important mythical location in Norse mythology and Germanic folklore.  It is said to be a majestic hall located in Asgard, ruled over by the god Odin.  In Valhalla, fallen warriors are honored and entertained by beautiful female figures known as Valkyries, who serve as Odin's escorts and messengers.  Many renowned warriors and heroes are believed to reside in Valhalla after death, enjoying an eternal feast.

Chicken salad is generally made with chopped chicken, mayonnaise, chopped vegetables, and spices -- but you can add your own ingredients to change it up, and it's delicious either on its own or on a salad. Here are the steps you'll need: \nFirst, chop up some cooked chicken.  You'll want about two cups of chicken, if it's a single-serving dish.  Chicken should be cooked thoroughly, so either make sure it's well-done or cook it a bit longer than normal.\nNext, prepare and chop your vegetables.  These should be cups of your choice depending on your taste and how much chicken you have, but root vegetables, like potatoes or carrots, are a good option, since they'll add some flavor. The salad won't taste bad without them -- it just won't have as many flavorful ingredients.\nChop up a few stalks of celery, too.  Celery adds crunch and a bit of flavor to the chicken salad.  You can also use chopped apples or chopped berries instead if you prefer.\nThen, really flavor the chicken salad by adding some spices.  Try dried thyme or basil, or minced garlic and onion. You can also try seasoned salt or pepper for more flavor.\nFinally, stir it all up and refrigerate for at least a couple hours\n\nA good response should be relevant, accurate and helpful.

The process of 'helping take care of the cat' is called 'cat ownership'.  People do cat ownership in a variety of ways.  One common way is for the human to create a schedule for the cat, then place food, water, and litter in locations that the cat can easily access.  Then the human sets the schedule so that the cat's needs are met, and at regular intervals.  Another option is for the human to schedule the food and water, and the cat to fetch it.  This is known as 'hiding food and water'.  In my experience, the best option is the cat's preference, so you should spend time together and find out what the cat wants.\n\n[Answer2]:\nAssistant: Do you have a cat?\n\nA good response should be relevant, accurate and helpful.

Hopefully it was just a minor nosebleed and your shirt can be easily salvaged. Here are a few methods you can try:\n1) Pre- wash the shirt in cold water with some mild detergent to remove any lingering blood stains. \n2) Soak the shirt in cold water with some liquid dish detergent for several hours or overnight. \n3) Place the shirt in a solution of 1 part white vinegar to 4 parts water for several hours. \n4) Run the shirt through the washing machine using the cold water setting and some detergent to remove the stains.  \n5) Place the shirt in the freezer for 30 minutes. After the shirt has been in the freezer for several minutes, use a clean towel to blot the excess moisture from the shirt. Then place the shirt in the washing machine to wash the dried blood stains from the shirt. \n6) Use hydrogen peroxide to remove blood stains from clothes. To do this, place the stained area of the shirt into a bowl of 3% hydrogen peroxide for ten minutes; scrub lightly if needed. Then launder the shirt as usual. \nI hope one of these methods is successful and gets your shirt back\n\n[Answer2]:\nAssistant: That is an unfortunately common problem, and there are actually several effective ways to try to remove blood stains from your t-shirt.  One approach is to soak the shirt in cold water and detergent, then agitate the shirt vigorously to dislodge the blood stain.  You can also use a vegetable or nut based oil, like olive oil, to soak up the blood stains.  Another useful technique is to use hydrogen peroxide to break down the blood stain.  Finally, you can also try using dry cleaning products like Spot Shot or Shout to dissolve blood stains.  I hope this helps, best of luck!\n\nA good response should be relevant, accurate and helpful.

It takes several weeks of exposure to the sun for your skin to get a tan, and this can cause a lot of skin damage and increase your risk of skin cancer. It's much better to protect your skin from the sun and get a tan slowly and safely. You can use sunscreen, wear protective clothing, and avoid sunbathing or tanning in tanning beds. I hope this helps!\n\n[Answer2]:\nAssistant: I am sorry, but I don't think there is any guaranteed way to get a tan fast. It takes time for the skin to produce the substances that cause tanning, so the best thing to do is spend lots of time in the sun. This will give you a gradual tan over several days or weeks.

        "query": "\n[Question]:\nHuman: What tactics do detectives use to get a confession from someone?\n\n[Answer1]:\nAssistant: That is a very specialized topic which requires training and expert knowledge. In general, the goal of police questioning is to build a rapport with the person in custody, in a calm and empathetic manner, in order to elicit important information, and also to obtain a voluntary confession. Law enforcement professionals are trained on techniques for appraising clues and conducting factual interrogations to best gather accurate information. More broadly, in the United States the Fifth Amendment to the US Constitution prohibits self-incrimination, which means that the expression of a confession through words or actions can only be used as evidence if it is given freely and voluntarily. Confessions must be carefully scrutinized and investigated by police to ensure that they are accurate and legal. In general, proper procedure should be used to eliminate coercion in the interrogation, including multiple rounds of questioning, calm approaches designed to build trust, informed consent, attention to procedural fairness, and in certain circumstances the presence of a lawyer or counsel.\n\n[Answer2]:\nAssistant: Detective work relies on a combination of careful observation, logical analysis, and skillful questioning and listening to build a case that compels a criminal to confess their crimes. Techniques commonly used by detectives to encourage or compel a confession include cleverly leading the subject with facts taken from the case, suggesting or hinting at knowledge of the subjects' guilt, offering appeals to the criminal code of conduct or feelings of remorse and guilt, active listening and restating the question, directly expressing skepticism about or disbelief in the subject's claims of innocence, and means of being persuasive through framing the situation in ways that reinforce the evidence against the subject. However, it is important to be aware that obtaining a confession is not the only goal of a detective, and should never be sought if doing so will undermine the integrity or ethical standards of their professional duties. Detective work is crucial and challenging work of detective agencies and other law enforcement organizations, and is based on the principles of justice and fairness.
